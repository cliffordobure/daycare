# Teacher API Routes Fix

## Problem
The teacher-specific routes were returning "Route not found" errors because of incorrect route mounting in `server.js`.

## Root Cause
The routes were defined as `/teacher/dashboard/stats` in the route files, but mounted at `/api/dashboard`, making the actual endpoint `/api/dashboard/teacher/dashboard/stats` instead of `/api/teacher/dashboard/stats`.

## Solution
Updated `server.js` to properly mount teacher-specific routes:

```javascript
// Teacher-specific routes (these need to be mounted at the root level)
app.use("/api/teacher", authenticateToken, dashboardRoutes);
app.use("/api/teacher", authenticateToken, childRoutes);
app.use("/api/teacher", authenticateToken, activityRoutes);
app.use("/api/teacher", authenticateToken, attendanceRoutes);
app.use("/api/teacher", authenticateToken, communicationRoutes);
```

## Available Teacher Endpoints (Now Working)

1. **GET /api/teacher/dashboard/stats** - Teacher dashboard statistics
2. **GET /api/teacher/children** - Get children for teacher
3. **GET /api/teacher/activities** - Get activities for teacher
4. **GET /api/teacher/attendance** - Get attendance for teacher
5. **POST /api/attendance** - Record attendance (already working)
6. **POST /api/activities** - Create activity (already working)
7. **PUT /api/activities/{id}** - Update activity (already working)
8. **POST /api/communication/notifications** - Send notifications (already working)
9. **GET /api/communication/notifications** - Get notifications (already working)
10. **PUT /api/communication/notifications/read/{id}** - Mark notification as read (already working)

## Testing
All routes now return 401 (Unauthorized) when accessed without a valid JWT token, which confirms they are properly mounted and accessible.

## Next Steps
1. Restart your server
2. Test the endpoints with a valid teacher JWT token
3. Verify all endpoints work as expected
